Narsa's Hotkey Plugin

Detect and take action when a key is pressed. To add hotkeys to your page, modify the
keyPressed function below as needed.

Tested (and working) in IE 8.0, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4.0 and Opera 10.10.

Acknowledgements: I looked at the source code for the very nice Legend of the Green Dragon
(http://lotgd.net/) keypress functionality while writing this, as well as a number of
references to see the difference in implementation between browsers.
